Ago is a small command line utility to compute the number of days between
two calendar dates. If just one date is given, the current date is assumed
for the second one.

    $ ago 2014-12-10 
    -123

    $ ago 2014-10-11 2014-12-04

# Installation

I recommend to compile and install ago via Opam, the OCaml packaging
manager:

    opam install ago

This installs a binary and a manual page which you can read as usual with
`man ago`.  Please note that the version on Opam might be slightly behind
this repository.

# Building

Ago is implemented in  OCaml. It does not rely on libraries outside
of the standard library and was developed with OCaml 4.02.1.

    make
    make PREFIX=/usr/local install

# Documentation

The ago utility comes with a Unix manual part which is installed by the
install target. It is built from ago.pod in the repository.
